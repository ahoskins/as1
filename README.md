# as1 - FuelTrack

The price of oil is really low right now, so we might as well use tools like FuelTrack and be as frugal as possible.
Who knows, maybe we can spend less on fuel than we do on our daily peppermint mocha runs.

FuelTrack is assignment #1 for CMPUT 301 at UAlberta.

# features
- add a new fuel entry (date, location, odometer reading, grade, amount, unit cost)
- edit an existing fuel entry
- view the list of all fuel entries
- view the total amount of money spent on fuel (this is where we save the money and buy more extra-low fat caramel macchiatos)
